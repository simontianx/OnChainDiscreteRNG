# OnChainRNG
This repo aims to create a set of on-chain discrete random number generators possibly for a few well studied ones including Bernoulli Distribution, Geometric Distribution, Binomial Distribution, and Negative Binomial Distribution. [Gaussian Distribution](https://github.com/simontianx/OnChainRNG/tree/main/GaussianRNG), supposedly a continuous distribution, can be approximated and thus is included as well.
