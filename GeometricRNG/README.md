# Geometric Random Number Generator
## Abstract
A novel on-chain Geometric random number generator is created. For the binary representation of a hashed value by the `keccak256` hashing algorithm, the number of `0`s it takes to see a `1` has a Geometric distribution. 

## Methodology
A Geometric distribution is often used to describe the probability of a certain number of failures before seeing a success. In the PoW consensus mechanism, generating hashed values with a certain number of leading zeros can be seen as sampling from a Geometric distribution.
